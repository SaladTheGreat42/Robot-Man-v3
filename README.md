# Robot Man

This is just a basic discord bot written in Python using the Discord.py library, mainly to challenge my own abilities but it also has tictactoe and reddit so that's cool 

## Help

Prefix is `>`, help command is `>help`, this defaults to a full list of command syntax for the bot, so don't worry about anything else

## FAQs

##### Are you aware you're ripping your formatting style from the [Proletariat Bot](https://repl.it/@RogerCronin1/Proletariat-Bot-3) git?

I have no idea what you're talking about

##### Why is your code so bad?

See above

##### How can I make my own discord bot?

There are countless sources online, but note that this bot uses the `discord.ext` extension of the `discord.py` library

##### How did you get such a good profile picture for the bot?

The profile picture source for all previous, present, and future iterations of Robot Man are stolen directly from the original Power Rangers tv show and similar works
